    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                Bloo Technologies operates the website "Spitter" at https://spitter.loophole.site.
                We take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy,
                we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information
                is collected and used.
              </p> <p><strong>Collection of Routine Information</strong></p> <p>
                This website track basic information about its visitors.
                This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details,
                timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific
                visitors to this website. The information is tracked for routine
                administration and maintenance purposes.
              </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                Where necessary, this website uses cookies to store information about a visitorâ€™s
                preferences and history to better serve the visitor and/or present the
                visitor with customized content. These cookies are secure and only last until
                you leave the site.
              </p> <p><strong>Advertisement and Other Third Parties</strong></p> <p>
                Advertising partners and other third parties DO NOT use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track
                visitor activities on this website to display advertisements
                and other useful information. Nobody else has your data.
              </p> <!----> <p><strong>Security, Data Storage and Law Enforcement</strong></p> <p>
                Your data security is very important. We have taken steps to ensure it never leaves our servers nefariously.
                If it does, and we find out, we WILL notify you within 48 hours of the breach.
                <br><br>
                Your data persists in our systems only as long as it is needed. We are firm believers in the delete button
                actually deleting, so once you click a delete button, the associated data is erased entirely. Exceptions
                are made to this for uploaded images. They are securely stored as long as the Spit containing them is
                posted, and may persist for up to 6 months after deletion- this is because as of this moment, the image
                is not autonomously deleted. Rest assured that they are not accessible.
                <br><br>
                Your data is uploaded to Spitter with the expectation that it is only seen to the extent you want it to be.
                We will protest and fight requests by law enforcement to view user data, particularly if it is not relevant
                to an investigation. Keep in mind we can't do very much of that, so your data may be handed off to law
                enforcement or criminal justice motions if we are unable or unwilling to stop it. We will take extra discretion
                over the choice to give data to governments in PRC, the Russian Federation, Iran, Myanmar, the United States 
                of America, or any other jurisdictions guilty of human rights violations.
              </p> <p><strong>Changes To This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2022-11-12 and will remain in effect except concerning
                any
                changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this
                page.
                We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and
                you
                should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy
                Policy,
                we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us or by
                placing a prominent notice on our website.
              </p> <p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p> <p>
